# 52 Golang Projects

Inspired by [52 technologies in 2016](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016), I've decided to take on the challenge to learn Go at the end of 2022 during Christmas - New Year break. The goal is to learn different aspect of Go, and build simple applications using what I've learned.

## Projects

1. **[Intro](https://github.com/dazhaoniel/52-golang-projects/tree/master/01_intro)** Following the [Go: The Complete Developer's Guide (Golang)](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/) course on Udemy, I wrote a number of small programs. Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language with memory management builtin.

2. **[DTranslator](https://github.com/dazhaoniel/52-golang-projects/tree/master/02_dtranslator)** A small command line project for translations between several languages. Using Google Translate API.

3. **[Cares](https://github.com/dazhaoniel/52-golang-projects/tree/master/03_cares)** I decided to rewrite my auto sign up for [New York Cares](https://www.newyorkcares.org/) projects script in Go. Instead of signing up, the script just lists available proejcts.

4. **[Project Euler](https://github.com/dazhaoniel/52-golang-projects/tree/master/04_project_euler)** A few easy Project Euler problems solved in Go, for me to practice math related functions.
