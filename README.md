# 52 Golang Projects

Inspired by [52 technologies in 2016](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016), I've decided to take on the challenge to learn Go at the end of 2022 during Christmas - New Year break. The goal is to learn different aspect of Go, and build simple applications using what I've learned.
